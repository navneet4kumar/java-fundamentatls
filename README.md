## What is this repository ?

Welcome to the **Java Fundamentals Repository**!

This repository is a comprehensive collection of exercises sourced from the essential chapters of the book **Introduction to Java Programing - Y.Daniel.Liang**.

This repository is designed to help you grasp the core concepts of Java programming, as well as _its a way for me to share my experience and knowledge I got while going through this book._

As you explore these exercises, you'll gain a solid understanding of the foundational elements that make _Java_, _Java_.

What makes this repository unique is that it contains _my takes_ on the exercises that are in this book. Feel free to **clone the repo** and give the exercises a try yourself.

**Whether you're a newcomer to coding or an experienced developer aiming to revisit the fundamentals, this repository is your companion for mastering Java while benefiting from the fusion of structured exercises and practical wisdom.**
